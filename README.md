yarp-legacy-devices
-------------------

This repository contains all the code and the commit history for all the
[YARP](https://github.com/robotology/yarp) devices that apparently are no longer
useful, or that could no longer be compiled.

There is no build system on purpose, If you are using or need one of these
devices, please let us know, so that we can either restore it in the main YARP
repository or on a separate repository.
